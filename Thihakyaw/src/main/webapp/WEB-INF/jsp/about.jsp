<div class="company-profile">
	<p>ACE Data Systems Ltd. was founded in 1992 as a small software
		house and IT training center. Nowadays, ACE Data Systems Group has
		grown into a group of nineteen companies with over six hundred
		employees with business operations in software development and system
		integration, outsourcing, IT infrastructure and cyber security,
		education services and e-commerce.</p>
	<p>As a pioneer in software industry, ACE Data Systems Ltd. (ACE)
		introduced Myanmar’s first computerized accounting system in 1993.
		Subsequently, ACE introduced various software solutions for banking
		and finance sector, retail and distribution sector, manufacturing
		sector, hotel, tourism and hospitality sector and become a leading
		software development and system integration company in Myanmar. In
		2013, ACE and Daiwa Institute of Research from Japan formed DIR-ACE
		Technology Ltd. (DAT) to provide IT solutions for capital market. DAT
		is playing a critical role in the development of capital market in
		Myanmar as IT solutions provider to Yangon Stock Exchange and
		securities companies. In 2017, Thuriya ACE Technology Ltd. (TAT) is
		established to provide IT solutions to insurance sector and healthcare
		sector. Nowadays, ACE and various global partners are working together
		to contribute to social economic development of Myanmar through
		digital transformations in financial sector, retail and distribution
		sector, manufacturing sector, hotel, tourism and hospitality sector,
		transportation and urbanization, public security, disaster control,
		healthcare and education.</p>
	<p>ACE is not only the pioneer in Myanmar software industry but
		also the pioneer in promoting Myanmar to become one of the new
		frontiers in global IT outsourcing destinations. ACE started promoting
		IT outsourcing in 1997. Due to the various social political issues and
		lack of proper enabling environment, the outsourcing business was not
		materialized in Myanmar until 2008. However, with the understanding on
		the importance of reaching to global market, ACE persistently worked
		hard to reach out to global market. The opening up of Myanmar since
		2010, the significant improvement in infrastructure and the
		availability of competitive workforce has attracted global attention
		and ACE’s outsourcing business has been growing steadily since then.
		ACE group’s companies such as ACE Data Systems Ltd. (ACE), Aceplus
		Solutions Ltd. (Aceplus), DIR-ACE Technology Ltd. (DAT), Thuriya ACE
		Technology Ltd. (TAT), XAN IT Solutions Ltd. (XAN) and Wild River Ltd.
		(Wild River) are all actively involving in outsourcing businesses
		targeting specific customer groups and specific technologies
		respectively. To be able to promote outsourcing business effectively,
		ACE Japan Ltd. (ACE Japan) was established in Japan in 2013 as the
		first IT company in Japan invested by a Myanmar national IT company.
		In addition, Myanmar Hi Tech Pte Ltd. (Myanmar Hi Tech) was
		established in Singapore in 2014 to conduct market survey and
		promotions in Singapore. Moving forward, ACE Data Systems Group will
		continue to spearhead IT export from Myanmar to the global market.</p>
	<p>In addition to international IT outsourcing, business process
		outsourcing (BPO) in Myanmar is also evolving. To be at the forefront
		of this trend, ACE has invested in Jing King (Myanmar) Solutions Ltd.
		(JK Myanmar) which will allow banks to streamline their card business
		by providing various BPO services. JK Myanmar is expected to become a
		key catalyst in the card and payment services evolution in Myanmar.</p>
	<p>Significant improvement in telecommunication infrastructure in
		recent years has allow organizations to pursue organization wide
		digital transformations where IT systems become vital components of
		the organizations’ competitiveness. For mission critical IT systems to
		be running at highest possible availability, the reliable, robust and
		secure IT Infrastructure is required. To be able to provide services
		to established reliable, robust and secure IT Infrastructure, ACE
		started IT infrastructure and cyber security services in 2013. In
		Myanmar where IT utilization is still at infancy stage, the demand for
		IT infrastructure and cyber security services are immense and ACE has
		taken some initiatives to fulfil some portion of the demand. In 2014,
		ACE Data Systems Ltd. and GMO Internet Group from Japan formed GMO
		Z.com ACE Ltd. (GMO-ACE) to provide internet infrastructure such as
		domain, hosting, SSL services. In addition, T3K Technology Ltd. (T3K)
		was established in 2015 to provide consulting services on IT
		Infrastructure construction initiatives. Moreover, ACE Data Systems
		Ltd. and Mitsuiwa Group from Japan formed Mitsuiwa-ACE Engineering
		Ltd. (MAE) in 2016 to provide server integration, network integration
		and cyber security solutions and services. With a good synergy within
		the group companies which are complementing each other, ACE is well
		positioned to become part of the IT infrastructure establishment and
		cyber security measures taken by a lot of organizations.</p>
	<p>Although ACE has reached 25 years of age, ACE’s backbone of
		success is always based on the young, energetic and innovative
		employees. ACE has significantly contributed to the development of IT
		industry by being able to produce over 2,000 IT engineers from its own
		IT training center over last 25 years. Nevertheless, the demand for
		qualified resources is ever increasing and to be able to fill the gap,
		ACE training center was spun-off and formed ACE Inspiration Ltd. (AI)
		in 2015 to expand IT education services. Nowadays, ACE Inspiration is
		focusing and expanding provision of IT professional courses,
		management courses and language courses to individuals and corporate
		customers.</p>
	<p>Future lifestyle of people will depend on various smart
		technologies and the line between IT engineering and other engineering
		disciplines are fading away. Not only that, it is becoming very
		important for Myanmar to generate, conserve and utilize energy in more
		efficient ways to make sure that social economic development does not
		impact environment and sustainability of our lives. To be able to
		contribute into that area, Sustainable Development Group Ltd. (SDG)
		was established in 2013 to provide energy management and green
		technology courses to individuals from various engineering
		disciplines. Moreover, SDG has started to provide consultation
		services on energy management, green building and smart society
		initiatives.</p>
	<p>In order to transform the education system in Myanmar, it is
		very important that the education providing at the foundation level is
		improved. To be able to contribute to that requirement, ACE and Gakken
		Holding Ltd. from Japan formed GAKKEN-ACE Education Services Ltd.
		(GAE) in 2014 to provide to bring affordable mathematics and science
		supplement courses to all the neighbourhoods in Myanmar. Since its
		foundation until June 2017, GAE has assisted opening of eight GAKKEN
		classrooms and more classrooms are under planning to be opened across
		the country to build up GAKKEN as a household brand for affordable
		education in Myanmar.</p>
	<p>With internet penetration and mobile penetration growing rapidly
		in Myanmar and high rate of economic development, e-commerce in
		Myanmar is expected to grow. ACE is preparing to play a significant
		role in the emergence of e-commerce and digital economy in Myanmar.
		Ever since its establishment in 2012, Aceplus has been helping
		businesses to start their digital channels through web and mobile
		developments. To be able to promote online businesses within ACE
		group, ACE Future Innovation (AFI) was established in 2015. Later, XAN
		digital bookstore and Koolpon discount coupon services were launched
		in subsequent years. ACE hopes to launch various e-commerce services
		to bring Myanmar in and beyond internet age in coming years.</p>
	<p>With clear visions and business strategies, ACE group is hoping
		to bring its 25 years of success into the future and to be one of the
		leading IT companies in Myanmar.</p>
